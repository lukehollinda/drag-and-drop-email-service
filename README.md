# drag-and-drop-email-service
A small Java application where users can drag files onto a window and automatically send themselves an email with the files attached, email headers are automatically timestamped. I made this application because I found myself using my email to transfer photos and links from my computer to my phone. 

To use on your own machine, simple switch out the username, password, and SMTP found in the the EmailService class. 

Note: If you are using Gmail, before you attempt to send an email make sure to go into your accounts security settings and turn on "Less secure app access"

GUI made with Java Swing. File identification using JavaActivation. Emails sent using JavaEmail API.
